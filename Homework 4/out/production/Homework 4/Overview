Tasks:
    1. create method addEltValidator()
        -takes a heap, an integer, and a binary tree (in that order)
        -returns true if the binary tree is a valid result of ADDING the given integer to the first Heap

    2. create method remMinEltValidator()
        -takes a heap, an integer, and a binary tree (in that order)
        -returns true if the binary tree is a valid result of REMOVING the given integer to the first Heap

Notes:
    addElt() is valid if...
        -retains all elements that were in the original heap while adding only the new element one time

    remMinElt() is valid if...
        -retains all elements that were in the original heap besides removing one occurrence of the smallest element

    What to check
    -Is it a heap?
    -Does the result contain all the elements from the original heap (the same number of occurrences)?
    -Has the new element been added (or removed)?
    -Are there no elements in result that weren't in original?
